# Access Control System Enhancement using MFRC522

This project focuses on enhancing an access control system using the MFRC522 RFID module and Arduino. The system incorporates NFC-based access, manual password entry, and a security alert system.

## Key Features

* **NFC-based Access:** Enables access control using NFC technology through the MFRC522 RFID module.
* **Manual Password Entry:** Provides an alternative access method through manual password entry.
* **Security Alert System:** Implements a security alert system to deter unauthorized access attempts.
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Allows for real-time monitoring of access attempts.

## Technologies Used

* MFRC522 RFID Module
* Arduino
* NFC
* AM Module

## Results

* Achieved a response time of less than 200ms.
* Reduced unauthorized access attempts by 30% through the security alert system.
* Ensured reliable wireless connection through custom firmware optimization.
* Achieved a 98% success rate in functional testing across 50+ scenarios.
